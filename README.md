## purpose
This project demonstrates my ability to create a project using Test Driven Development and is part of my journey through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). I began the project creating tests for my various objects and then added the code that passed those tests. I also tried my best to write code that has loose coupling. I utilized the [PubSub-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pubsub-js) package to help with this. Please feel free to give any advice you may have!

## features
- Allows the user to place their ships onto their gameboard
- Creates a randomly generated attack fro the Ai
- Allows you to retry after one player's ships are all destroyed
